# Vue Landing Page

This page's content is partially manageable through Sanity CMS; credentials are required and must be requested.

The project panel features three subpages with forms: **Site Settings**, **Stats**, and **Accesses**. Updates are applied only after saving the form by clicking the publish button.

## Site Settings

This section offers several customization options:

- **Site Title**: Adjust the page title for SEO optimization.
- **Headings**: Choose headings in white and green for the first significant content block, serving as the page description for SEO purposes. Fields can be left blank to enable headings in different colors.
- **Paragraph**: This is a descriptive text for the page, located beneath the heading on the landing page.
- **Call to Action**: The text for the main button.

## Stats

This displays the number of courses, lessons, and hours completed by clients. It is not manually updatable; if any fields are left blank, form can't be published.

## Accesses

This section permits the modification of the number of features available to different bundle's purchasers, with selectable options ranging from 1 to 5.
